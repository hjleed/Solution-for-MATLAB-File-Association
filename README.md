# Solution-for-MATLAB-File-Association
It creates a Windows registry file that solves an issue with MATLAB file associations in Windows, e.g., that m-files doesn't open up in MATLAB or opens up in a new instance.  

This program is also to add missing MATLAB shortcuts to the Windows desktop and start menu and a small Windows batch file to start MATLAB.
